String Agenda:
-------------
1) What is a String?
2) Creating String Classes
3) Some common String class Methods
4) Immutability vs Mutability


1) What is a String?
   ----------------- 

A String is a sequence of characters written in double quotes.

"youtube"
"@facebook"
"Alley Road"
"4th May"


2) Creating String Classes
   -----------------------

Strings in java are represented by the String Class.
Objects of this class are created to store a sequence of characters,which are called  "Strings"

1) Enclose the String literals in quotes.

syntax : String name="ravilella";
(creating the string using the assignment operator)


2) Alternative way to create Strings

 syntax : String n=new String("ravilella");


String, 
StringBuffer, 
StringBuilder

String (vs) StringBuffer (vs) StringBuilder :
---------------------------------------------
1) If the content is fixed and won't change frequently then we should go for String.

2) If the content is not fixed and keep on changing but Thread Safety is required then we should go for StringBuffer.


3) If the content is not fixed and keep on changing and thread safety is not required then we should go for StringBuilder.




Different b/w String & String Buffer
------------------------------------

String is immutable  (which objects can't be changeable)
String Buffer is mutable ((which objects can be changeable))

1) Once we creates a string object we can't perform any changes in the existing object.If we are trying to perform any changes with those changes a new object will be created.this non changeable nature is nothing but immutablility of the String Object.

2) Once we creates a StringBuffer object we can perform any type of changes in the existing object.This changeble is nothing but mutability of the StringBuffer object.


Different b/w String Buffer & String Builder
--------------------------------------------
StringBuilder is exactly same as StringBuffer(Including Methods and Constructors) except the following differences.

String Buffer:
---------------
1) Every method is synchronized
2) Thread-Safe
3) Relatively performance is low
4) Introduced in java v 1.0

String Builder:
---------------
1) Every method is Non-synchronized
2) Non Thread-Safe
3) Relatively performance is High
4) Introduced in java v 1.5







3) Some important methonds in String
   ---------------------------------


1) char charAt(int k)
       Return the character @ position k

2) int length()
        Returns the length of the String

3) String toLowerCase(), toUpperCase()
        Returns a String with lowercase,uppercase characters.

4) int indexOf(String sub)
        Returns the index of first occurrence of the specified String
