1. Handling Multiple Windows:
   -------------------------


What are multiple Windows?

 >  For suppose we have "WINDOW-A".Clicking on a link of WINDOW-A will open a new     "WINDOW-B" and clicking on a link of "WINDOW-B" will open a new "WINDOW-C".

 >  Here WINDOW-A, WINDOW-B, WINDOW-C are called as multiple windows.

 > In order to perform any action on the "WINDOW-B" or "WINDOW-C", we need to switch    driver focous accordingly.We can switch to the desired window using below syntax.


Syntax:
-------

   driver.switchTo().window(handle/name);


By using below methods we will get windows handle

a. getWindowHandle(); ---> Return a string of alphanumeric window handle
b. getWindowHandles(); ---> Return a set of window handles which can be used to iterate over all open windows.  





2. Handling Frames:
   ----------------

In a webPage,there might be some element that exists inside the iframe/frame.We cannot directly perform any action on the elements that exists in the iframe/frame,for that we need to switch into iframe/frame and then perform action on it.


We can switch to frame unsing 3 different ways


     1.) Using By Index : Select a frame by its (Zero-based) index	
	    driver.switchTo().frame(index);

     2.) Using By Locator : Select a frame using its previously located by identification method like id,Xpath,cssselector
	    driver.switchTo().frame(locator);



3. Handling Multiple Frames:
   -------------------------

To Handle multiple frames we will switch the control back to the main window.To do this you can use the following 

syntax: 
-------

 driver.switchTo().defaultContent();


Note:  defaultContent() Selects either the first frame on the page ,or the main document when a page contains iframes
